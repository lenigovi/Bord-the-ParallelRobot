    "Applications of six-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) spatial parallel mechanisms (SPMs) can be found in many areas such as robotics, motion simulators and high-precision positioning devices due to their properties of high payload capability and positioning accuracy. However, the performances of such mechanisms are limited by singularities within their workspace, especially parallel (type II) singularities [1]–​[4]."

    "When the mobility of at least one of the legs is greater than the required DoF, the mechanism is said to be kinematically redundant. This can be used for singularity avoidance and workspace enlargement [12]–​[15]. If extra legs are added to the mechanism or if some of the passive joints are actuated, the mechanism is said to be redundantly actuated [16]. Such type of redundancy may help to avoid singularities and increase stiffness [17]. However, redundantly actuated mechanisms may also generate internal forces, which lead to control and calibration complexities [18], [19]. Measurement redundancy can be achieved by using more sensors than the number of actuated joints and is introduced to improve the accuracy of the mechanism [20]. However, it does not help to avoid singularities. It can therefore be argued that kinematic redundancy is a very attractive way to achieve singularity avoidance. A detailed analysis of SPMs with several different kinematically redundant legs can be found in [21].\n",

In each leg, one of the three motors is attached to the fixed base while the other two form a planar parallel mechanism mounted on the output link of the first actuator. Using this arrangement, it is shown that type II singularities can be completely avoided."

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to obtain all the possible postures of the platform by utilizing the previous approach, in practical applications, a unique solution is desired. The Newton–Raphson method can be used for this purpose. Because the direction cosines of the $z'$-axis, denoted by $q_z$, are the same as the vector $z_1$ given in Eq. (2), the remaining unknown parameters are the direction cosines of the $x'$- and $y'$-axes, denoted, respectively, by $q_x$ and $q_y$, and the position vector $p$, which contains in total nine variables. Thus, a system of nine constraint equations can be formed to implement the Newton–Raphson method.\n",

    "As it can be observed from Fig. 2, a constraint equation on the squared length of each redundant link can be written as\n",
