    "# Forward Kinematic Analysis of a KRHPR with RRRSR Legs\n",
    "## Approach One: Newton-Raphson\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to obtain all the possible postures of the platform by utilizing the previous approach, in practical applications, a unique solution is desired. The Newton–Raphson method can be used for this purpose. Because the direction cosines of the z′-axis, denoted by qz, is the same as the vector z1 which is given in Eq. (2), the remaining unknown parameters are the direction cosines of the x′- and y′-axes, denoted, respectively, by qx and qy, and the position vector p, which contains in total nine variables. Thus, a system of nine constraint equations can be formed to implement the Newton–Raphson method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be observed from Fig. 2, a constraint equation on the squared length of each redundant link can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\left(\\boldsymbol{p} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{d}_i - \\boldsymbol{p}_i\\right)^T \\left(\\boldsymbol{p} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{d}_i - \\boldsymbol{p}_i\\right) - l_{i4}^2 = 0, \\quad i = 1, 2, 3 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "in which \\(\\boldsymbol{Q} = [q_x \\quad q_y \\quad q_z]\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the vectors \\((p_1 − p)\\) and \\(q_z\\) are always orthogonal, and therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\left(\\boldsymbol{p}_1 - \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)^T \\boldsymbol{q}_z = 0 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the rotation matrix must be orthogonal, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\boldsymbol{Q}^T \\boldsymbol{Q} - \\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{0} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(\\boldsymbol{I}\\) is the \\(3 \\times 3\\) identity matrix. Equation (6) provides five constraint equations since \\(q_z\\) is obtained from the outset using Eq. (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Eqs. (4), (5), and (6) yields a system of nine equations in nine unknowns\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\boldsymbol{0} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\\[ \\boldsymbol{X} = [ \\boldsymbol{q}_x^T \\quad \\boldsymbol{q}_y^T \\quad \\boldsymbol{p}^T ]^T \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "and where most of the equations are nonlinear. The Newton–Raphson method at iteration \\(k\\) can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Solve} \\quad \\boldsymbol{F}'(\\boldsymbol{X}) \\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^{(k)} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{(k)}\\right) = -\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X}^{(k)}) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{(k)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\boldsymbol{X}^{(k+1)} = \\boldsymbol{X}^{(k)} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{(k)}, \\quad k = 0, 1, \\ldots \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{F}'(\\boldsymbol{X})\\) is the partial derivative of vector \\(\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X})\\) with respect to vector \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) and is of dimension \\(9 \\times 9\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure stops when the equations are satisfied within a predetermined accuracy. With a proper initial guess (which is usually available in the continuous tracking of a trajectory), the procedure converges very quickly (typically less than four iterations are required).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach Two: Using One Extra Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible way to avoid the use of a numerical method while limiting the number of possible solutions consists in adding extra encoders to the passive joints to acquire more information. We start the analysis by adding an encoder to joint R14 to measure the magnitude of angle \\( \\beta_1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Fig. 5, the vectors \\(v_i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) construct a planar 4-bar linkage whose vector loop equation expressed in the intermediate frame \\(S_1x_1y_1z_1\\) can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\boldsymbol{v}_2 + \\boldsymbol{v}_3 = \\boldsymbol{v}_1 + \\boldsymbol{v}_4 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Eq. (10) in matrix form yields\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{v}_2 \\cos(\\alpha_1) \\\\ \\boldsymbol{v}_2 \\sin(\\alpha_1) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{v}_3 \\cos(\\phi) \\\\ \\boldsymbol{v}_3 \\sin(\\phi) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{v}_4 \\cos(\\alpha_2) \\\\ \\boldsymbol{v}_4 \\sin(\\alpha_2) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( \\phi = \\alpha_1 - \\gamma \\) with \\(v_i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) denotes the norm of the corresponding vector. Equation (11) can be rewritten as\n",
